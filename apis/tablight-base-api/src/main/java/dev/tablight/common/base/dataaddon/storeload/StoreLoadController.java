/**
 * Controller of "store load" mechanism of {@link DataAddon} instances.
 * <p>
 * Definitions: in our "custom" Registrable type we have two types of data:
 * "custom" and "native".
 * <p>
 * Suppose we have "CustomEntity" class, in this class we have "EntityType entityType" field, and "EntityEmotions entityEmotions".
 * "entityType" exists in minecraft, and we want to have the same field that matches the original Entity's "entityType", it is native data.
 * On the other hand we have "entityEmotions" field which is our "custom" data attached to our "CustomEntity" type, it is custom data.
 * <p>
 * But where we supposed to instantiate "CustomEntity" type if it has native data? This is where {@link StoreLoadLookup} is needed.
 * In your implementation you need to specify {@link StoreLoadLookup} which will look for native "Entity" data,
 * for some reasons distinguish which entities should be "custom" and which shouldn't, make new instances of
 * "CustomEntity", hold them and after that {@link #load(Class)} "custom" data in them.
 * And when your "CustomEntity" dies you store "custom" data and release it in holder.
 * <p>
 * And congrats! You have fully configured "CustomEntity" instances in your holder, so you can handle with them in the way you prefer.
